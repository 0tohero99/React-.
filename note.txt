NOTE: 
    frontend runs on database and backend is the part of the server so cannot interect with each other and need backend to interect .

    Any frontend can have any backend only need is that 
    apis should return the json format of data.

    structure :
     frontend = interect = > backend = interect = > database .= server(to make it live where aplication deploye) .

MERN : Advantage:
    = mongodb (database) follow the structure of the react
      (i.e.json) is also javascripts.
    = express and node (backend) it is also javascripts.
    = react (frontend) is also javascripts.

Apis :
    It is a url developed in backend by any language 
    and it should return data in json format of data .

    React want the url that return data in json format dosn't matter it is made with any language i.e. java python .net etc. 

open source : 
  = anyone can contribute to the development.

NPM : 
  = node pakage manager .
  = it is a open source registery where pakages is kept that anyone can use & contribute to the development.

pakages.json :
  = entry point to the aplication .
  = all the pakages install .
  = all the commands (start,test,build).
  = meta data (name,version,descriptions).

steps to generate pakages.json : 
= go inside the folder using terminal.
= npm init .
= answer all the questions .
= enter or.
= npm init -y.

steps to install pakages : 
= go inside the folder using terminal.
= npm i pakagename .
= npm i axios .
= ex. : npm i axios .

node_modules : 
  = contains all the pakage installed .
pakage-lock.json : 
  = dependency tree i.e. it tells which pakage depends upon what.

Note: npm i for node node_modules. it automatically checks the pakage.json file and install it.

.gitignore : 
  anything (that is heavy i.e. folders) that we dont want to push to git we have to write in it.

steps to generate react aplications  : 
  = go inside the folder using terminal.
  = npx create-react-app appname
